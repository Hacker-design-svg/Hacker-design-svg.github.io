My name is Gurman Singh.I study in VIII class in Partap Public School, Ludhiana. It is situated near Radha Swami Satsang Bhawan. I was born on 20 September 2010. I am very curios to learn about new technology. I want to become IAS officer by giving the UPSC competitive exam. This is one of the most difficult competitive exam. My hobby is to play cricket in free time and to listen songs. During solving maths problems I listen music to motivate myself. This is all about me.

Today is Saturday. The Weather is extremely hot. The level of humidity is very high. Today I have to complete my notebooks and do maths homework. It is so boring to complete notebooks. Firs I have done my breakfast and then i watched Television for some time. Then I have started completing my work. After completing the work I have done my maths homework. Then I have watched mobile for sometime to fresh my mood. Then in evening I go for playing cricket with my friends.This is all about my today's schedule.
